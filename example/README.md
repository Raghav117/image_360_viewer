### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features Demo
- **Gyroscope Control**: Rotate objects by tilting your device
- **Simulated Lighting**: Dynamic shadow effects based on rotation angle
- **Mirror Playback**: Auto-rotation with direction reversal

## Running the Example

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed
2. Navigate to the example directory:
   ```bash
   cd example
   ```
3. Get dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Code Examples

### Basic Network Usage
```dart
Image360Viewer.networkList(
  imageUrls: [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    // ... more URLs
  ],
  autoRotate: true,
  zoomEnabled: true,
)
```

### Asset Usage
```dart
Image360Viewer.asset(
  assetPath: 'assets/product/frame_',
  frameCount: 24,
  fileExtension: 'jpg',
  autoRotate: true,
  zoomEnabled: true,
)
```

### Advanced Configuration
```dart
Image360Viewer.networkList(
  imageUrls: imageList,
  autoRotate: true,
  reverseOnEnd: true,
  gyroEnabled: true,
  autoRotateSpeed: 150,
  shadowIntensityByFrame: (frameIndex) {
    // Custom lighting calculation
    final angle = (frameIndex / totalFrames) * 2 * pi;
    return (sin(angle) + 1) * 0.3;
  },
)
```

## Navigation

The example app has three main sections accessible via bottom navigation:

1. **Network** - Remote image loading examples
2. **Assets** - Local asset examples (requires setup)
3. **Advanced** - Special features like gyroscope and lighting

## Notes

- The asset demo requires you to add your own image sequence to the `assets/demo/` folder
- Gyroscope features work best on physical devices
- Network demos use placeholder images from picsum.photos
